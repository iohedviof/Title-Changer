## BIG FAT DISCLAIMER PLEASE CHECK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SPOILER
Hi guys! I made this new cool mod that... changes your game title... I know, not too impressive but this is my very first mod. It has its own config, and because config, it requires Cloth Config to access it and Mod Menu to actually configure it (it's easier to do it this way and not using files) \
This mod also has a Forge AND NeoForge version, Forge has only 1.20.1 support but NeoForge has 1.21.x support. \
The Fabric version is open-source but sadly NeoForge and Forge are closed source, sorry :( \
[YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) are required for Fabric 1.2.0+ (Mod Menu is optional starting from 1.3.0), 1.1.2 and below require [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) (NeoForge requires only YACL in versions 1.2.0+, needs only Cloth Config in 1.1.0 and below). Forge requires [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).

**Regarding Forge**:

The Forge version is currently half broken and I can't seem to fix bugs with it. The mod breaks during starting loading screen, switching between GUI's very fast and world loading screen where it just reverts back to normal. Unfixable bug so please don't make issues on GitHub saying that it doesn't work, I cannot fix it. NeoForge and Fabric are stable and there seem to be no issues and these are probably going to be the only versions I'll develop, Forge is not gonna get any new features, NeoForge and Fabric will.

**Regarding Fabric + NeoForge 1.2.0+**:

For the sake of your sanity, PLEASE READ THIS. For NeoForge, use YACL 3.6.2 and Sodium 0.5.11 if you're on 1.21.0. Do NOT use this mod on Fabric (1.21.0 only, 1.21.1+ work perfectly fine), YACL implodes on any version that somewhat supports 1.21.0 visually. 3.6.3+ asks for Fabric API version only available for 1.21.1, 3.6.2 and below require Fabric Resource Loader v0 or some bs idk but kindly use 1.21.1+ for Fabric and the recommended versions for NeoForge (sodium 0.6.13 implodes on 1.21.0 NeoForge for some reason).

**Regarding 1.3.0+**:

NeoForge updates will be delayed by a day or two, because updates further on will add a ton more content and I can't deliver the version with a ton of content on both loaders, so when I'm done making Fabric, I upload Fabric, take a day-long break and on the next day I start work on NeoForge. This is just a disclaimer to you guys if you're confused as to why NeoForge gets delayed. It is NOT cancelled, I don't plan on stop updating NeoForge any time soon. However one thing I'm considering for 1.4.0 is making this mod be compatible with the three currently available loaders in one combined .jar file.
